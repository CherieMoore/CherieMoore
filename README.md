<h1>👋🏾 Hey there, I'm Cherie!</h1>

<body> 

I'm a Social Media Marketing Manager by day and a Software Engineering student by night, looking to break into the engineering world. I'm currently obtaining a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering. I'm also a parttime student w/ #Brainstation, an accelerated, immersive program featuring hands-on curriculum focused on software engineering, computer science and application development.

✈️ I enjoy traveling the world, 👩🏽‍💻learning new coding languages and 🎫sitting front row at concerts...because 2nd row and behind doesn't have the same impact. 😃
